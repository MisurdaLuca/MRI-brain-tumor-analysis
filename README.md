# 🧠 MRI Brain Tumor Analysis

## Status: Finished

## 👋🏼 Welcome to my project work!

This repository is part of a semester-long assignment for the **Machine Vision and Image Processing in Healthcare** course at the **University of Óbuda**, within the **Artificial Intelligence specialization**.

The goal of this project is to build a pipeline that processes, analyzes, and extracts features from MRI brain images, aiming to support tumor detection and classification tasks using both classical AI methods and modern preprocessing techniques.

## 📂 Project Structure

Coming soon...

## 🧪 Functionality
- ✅ **Intensity normalization** to standardize voxel values
- ✅ **2D feature extraction** from selected slices (e.g. using SIFT, SURF, HOG)
- ✅ **CSV output** for machine learning integration
- ✅ **Class-based image organization**
- ✅ **Training classical AI models** (e.g. SVM, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors) using extracted features

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- `Python 3.10+`
- `Shutil`
- `OpenCV`
- `NumPy`
- `Matplotlib`
- `scikit-image`
- `scikit-learn`
- `nilearn`
